# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) Deployment and Configuration Project

## Objective

The objective of this project was to deploy and configure a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Suricata to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and potential threats. The project aimed to improve network security by detecting unauthorized access attempts, malware, and attack signatures in real time. The hands-on experience included rule customization, alerting mechanisms, and analyzing network traffic to gain a deeper understanding of how to protect enterprise environments from evolving cyber threats.

### Skills Learned

- NIDS Deployment and Configuration: Hands-on experience in deploying Suricata as an Intrusion Detection System to monitor live network traffic for anomalies.
- Threat Detection: Proficient in recognizing malicious network activity, such as port scanning, brute-force attacks, and malware communication, through signature-based detection.
- Rule Customization: Advanced skills in writing and tuning IDS rules to reduce false positives and ensure accurate detection of threats.
- Log Analysis: Practical experience in parsing IDS logs and correlating events to identify patterns of suspicious behavior.
- Incident Response: Gained knowledge in responding to detected incidents, such as isolating compromised devices and blocking malicious traffic.
- Network Traffic Analysis: In-depth understanding of network protocols and packet analysis, using Wireshark to inspect traffic and validate IDS alerts.
- Security Best Practices: Familiarity with hardening the IDS environment, configuring network segmentation, and implementing firewall rules to complement detection efforts.

### Tools Used

- Suricata: Deployed and configured as the primary NIDS for real-time traffic monitoring and threat detection.
- Kibana: Used for visualizing and analyzing logs generated by Suricata, providing an intuitive interface for tracking alerts and incident trends.
- Wireshark: Used to capture and analyze network packets, identifying abnormal patterns and verifying IDS alerts.
- ElasticSearch: Implemented as a log management system to store and query large volumes of IDS event data.
- pfSense: Configured in conjunction with Suricata to control network access and enhance security posture.
